# Roadmap for Learning Node.js

## 1. **Foundations**
### Prerequisites:
- **JavaScript Basics** (2-3 weeks):
  - Variables, Data Types, Loops, Conditionals.
  - Functions (arrow functions, callbacks).
  - ES6+ Features (Promises, async/await, modules).
  - Basic DOM manipulation (optional).
- **Basic Understanding of the Command Line** (1 week):
  - Navigating file systems, running scripts.
- **Version Control (Git)** (1 week):
  - Basic Git commands and repositories.

## 2. **Getting Started with Node.js**
### Installation and Setup (1-2 days):
- Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
- Set up a basic Node.js project with `package.json`.
- Learn how to run JavaScript code using Node.js.

### Core Concepts (1 week):
- **Modules and Imports**:
  - CommonJS (require/module.exports).
  - ES6 Modules (import/export).
- **Global Objects**:
  - `__dirname`, `__filename`.
  - `console`, `process`, `Buffer`.
- **npm Basics**:
  - Installing and using packages.
  - Understanding `package.json` and `node_modules`.

## 3. **Node.js Core Modules** (2 weeks):
- **File System (fs)**:
  - Read/Write files asynchronously and synchronously.
- **Path Module**:
  - Handling and manipulating file paths.
- **HTTP Module**:
  - Creating basic HTTP servers.
- **OS Module**:
  - Working with operating system-related utilities.
- **Events Module**:
  - Event emitters and listeners.

## 4. **Asynchronous Programming** (1-2 weeks):
- **Understanding Callbacks**:
  - Write and manage nested callbacks.
- **Promises**:
  - Handle asynchronous tasks with `.then()` and `.catch()`.
- **Async/Await**:
  - Simplify asynchronous code.
- **Event Loop and Non-blocking I/O**:
  - Understand how Node.js handles concurrency.

## 5. **Building Web Applications**
### Frameworks and Libraries (2 weeks):
- **Express.js**:
  - Set up routes, middleware, and static file serving.
  - Handle requests and responses.
  - Error handling.
- **Templating Engines** (e.g., Pug, EJS):
  - Render dynamic HTML pages.

### REST APIs (1 week):
- Learn the principles of RESTful APIs.
- Build and test APIs using tools like Postman or Thunder Client.

### Middleware (1 week):
- Create custom middleware.
- Use built-in middleware like `express.json()`.

## 6. **Working with Databases**
### SQL Databases (2 weeks):
- Use libraries like `pg` for PostgreSQL or `mysql`.
- Perform basic CRUD operations.

### NoSQL Databases (2 weeks):
- Use MongoDB with Mongoose.
- Design schemas and perform CRUD operations.

### ORMs (1 week):
- Explore ORMs like Sequelize or Prisma.

## 7. **Error Handling and Debugging** (1 week):
- Handle errors gracefully with `try/catch`.
- Use error-handling middleware in Express.
- Debug code using `console.log`, Node.js debugger, or VS Code debugger.

## 8. **Authentication and Security** (2 weeks):
- Learn about JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
- Use libraries like Passport.js.
- Secure applications with:
  - Helmet.js.
  - Rate-limiting.
  - Data validation (e.g., `Joi` or `express-validator`).

## 9. **Advanced Topics** (3-4 weeks):
- **Streams**:
  - Work with readable and writable streams.
  - Handle large file operations.
- **Cluster and Worker Threads**:
  - Scale Node.js applications using clustering.
- **WebSockets**:
  - Build real-time applications using libraries like Socket.io.
- **Testing**:
  - Write unit tests with Mocha, Chai, or Jest.
  - Test APIs with Supertest.

## 10. **Build and Deploy** (2 weeks):
- **Deployment**:
  - Host applications on platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS.
  - Use Docker for containerization.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Manage sensitive data with `dotenv`.
- **Build Tools**:
  - Use tools like Webpack or Parcel for bundling assets (optional).

## 11. **Project Ideas** (Ongoing):
- Build a basic blog or to-do app.
- Create a REST API for a bookstore or movie database.
- Develop a chat application with real-time messaging.
- Implement an authentication system with login/logout.

## 12. **Community and Learning Resources** (Ongoing):
- Follow the official Node.js documentation.
- Explore open-source projects on GitHub.
- Participate in communities like Reddit, Stack Overflow, or Discord.
- Take courses on platforms like Udemy, freeCodeCamp, or YouTube.
